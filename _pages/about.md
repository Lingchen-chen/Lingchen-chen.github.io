I am currently a doctoral student at the [CGL Lab](https://cgl.ethz.ch), ETH Zurich, supervised by [Prof. Markus Gross](https://cgl.ethz.ch/people/grossm), [Prof. Barbara Solenthaler](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/~sobarbar/index.html), and [Dr. Derek Bradley](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/~bradleyd/). My research intersects computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. I am passionate about democratizing physics-based human simulation via machine learning, aiming to establish a new standard in digital human modeling and animationâ€”a field crucial to modern entertainment, medicine, and education.

During my doctoral studies, I have the privilege of collaborating with [Disney Research Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) on physics-based facial simulation, where I had the invaluable opportunity to work alongside [Prof. Eftychios Sifakis](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sifakis/). Before that, I earned my master's degree at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. Youyi Zheng, [Prof. Kun Zhou](http://www.kunzhou.net/), and [Prof. Hongbo Fu](https://sweb.cityu.edu.hk/hongbofu/).
